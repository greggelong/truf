truf - teaching recursion using fractals

I am using a very simple turtle graphics class called gurtle that I made

https://github.com/greggelong/gurtle

In this repo I am refactoring  code that was originally in a 1988

paper on prolog and recursion. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221536954_Teaching_recursion_using_fractals_in_Prolog

## some notes on recursion method

I have previously created most of these fractals using L-systems.

such as:

and more on fractals and l-systems
